# BambuLab-logger

<p>
    This script will be used for easier logging of prints from bambulab straight to excel(.xlsx).
</p>
<p>
    Right now the program is underwork and not functional.
    I will be making repeated commits to this project so dont worry.
</p>
<p>
    The program will communicate with the BambuLab printer via APIs. Which means that the printed has to be set in LAN mode and not the "cloud" mode. That of course means sacrificing the features for e.g. starting prints out of your LAN and etc.
